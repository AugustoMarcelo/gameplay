## ðŸ¤¯ Faced problems

In this section, I'll list a problem that I came across and how I have resolved.

For some reason, RectButton from react-native-gesture-handler don't works fine when placed directly inside React Native Modal component (see [SignOut component](https://github.com/AugustoMarcelo/gameplay/blob/main/src/components/SignOut/index.tsx#L25)). I didn't want to lose the effect provided by RectButton, so I wrapped it up with TouchableWithoutFeedback.
